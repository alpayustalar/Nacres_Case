I developed a web application using .Net MVC technologies. I made Company and Employee definitions through this application. 
Company Name, Tax Office, Tax Number and Address information are available. 
Employee's Name and Surname, T.C. Identity Number, Company information are available. I determined the employee's Company information as one of the
existing companies in the system. I set it up so that an employee can only work at one company.
New companies can be defined on the system, existing companies can be viewed, edited and
deleted. New employees can be defined, existing employees can be viewed, edited and deleted on the system.
